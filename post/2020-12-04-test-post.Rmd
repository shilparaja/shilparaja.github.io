###Exploring Python Functions

```{python}
#counting the frequency of nucleotides in a sample DNA sequence
def count_characters(sequence):
  counts = {}
  for c in sequence:
      if c in counts:
        counts[c]+=1
      else:
        counts[c]=1
  for c in counts:
    print("number of times", c, "appears:", counts[c])
    
sequence_1 = "gatcctccatatacaacggt"
count_characters(sequence_1)
```

```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)
toothgrowth <- ToothGrowth
#examining tooth growth in animals as a function of supplement type (orange juice or ascorbic acid/vitamin C) and dosage level
```

```{python}
r.toothgrowth
tooth_growth_df = (r.toothgrowth
.groupby(['supp','dose'])
.agg(['mean']))
print(tooth_growth_df)
```

###Regular Expressions

```{python}
import re
mrna = "AUGCUUAGUCGACAC"
codons = re.findall(r"...", mrna)
print(codons)
codons_string = str(codons)

if re.search(r"CU[UCAG]", codons_string):
  print("Amino acid leucine identified.")

if re.search(r"GU[UCAG]", codons_string):
  print("Amino acid valine identified.")
```
